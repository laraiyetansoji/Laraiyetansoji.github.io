   My name is laraiyetan bidemi soji,i want to discuss about my achivement right from the begining of my life till date.<br>
I proceed i will like to briefly describe the word achievement.<br> Achievement can simply explain as what someone or somebody has done successfully in his/her
life especially using his own personal effort/capability.<br>
This reminds me of those days when i was in nusary/primaary school (steppingstone nursery,pimary and secondary), there is that paticular friends that we always compete together to become leader of that great school/class
but fortunate enough, when i was in primary (5) second and third term i came out with 1st position out 29 students, due to this success i was priviledge to become their sport prefect in around (2008/09). This same year i seated for an entrance exam to junior secondary school God so good i passed this exam and became secondary school student immediatly.<p>
While geting to secondary school(jarspok secondary school), i met different students from different primary schools and some of my pervious school mate too, i wrote my first exam and came out with 2nd position out of nomerous number of students.However, i register for junior waec i read very hard during this period of preparing,
God so good i seated for the exam and had excellent reasult, this made me to become senior secondary school student.<br>
My first year in (sss) classes was so amazing and wonderful because out of up to 18 to 20 subject i had 15 excellents, in sss2 our class was devided into different department where i was luckly found myself in social science department.
In short, during my sss3 in this school i was served as their senior prefect also.I wrote my ssce and passed.<br>
Troughtout my secondary i do have ambition to further my education but did not think of coming to(kwasu) but God always did his things in mysterious ways.<p>
In around 2014 after stayed home for good 4 month i went into different programmes for three years  in rivers state, oyo state and kwara state.<br>
I bought jamb form in ilorin at oyun one of jamb branch, i seated for this exam and passed. due to that success i have to proceed by applying for kwasu admission, i was admited, recently i am now lucky student of kwara state university, malete, department of library and information science.<p>
